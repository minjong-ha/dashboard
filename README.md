# Dashboard
Dashboard presents personal workspace webpage project: full size info-screen for me
I will customize the web-site only for me, but it could be a good reference for whom want to implement their own webpage.
To avoid the leakage of personal/private information, some of the source code could be uploaded as a skeleton codes.
But I want to upload the full source codes as many as possible since it is the more safe way on the security (it is my personal opinion).

# Framework
I decide to implement Single Page Application (SPA)[\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).
Followings represent the reason why I choose SPA, not the traditional one.

* I will deploy the web-server on my personal raspberry pi 4.
Since the performance of it is very limited, I should reduce the traffic or server-burden tasks.

* I want my web-page works real-time.
The main feature of the Dashboard is the notification.
I want to synchronize my personal notifications as many as possible using the REST API: Message service, mail, and etc.

There are two options for me: react.js and vue.js
So many posts in tech-blogs already compared them.
In my personal opinion, vue.js can implement codes more short and clear.
It also has better performance than react.js, and easy to use for the beginners as far as I know.
However, react.js has more well-refined documents and references.
Personally, I value the good references and documents more and it is the reason why I select react.js.
